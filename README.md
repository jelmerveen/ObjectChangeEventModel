# ObjectChangeEventModel
A Typescript model that calls a function when data has changed.

ObjectWatch.ts is based on https://github.com/sindresorhus/on-change with a minor rewrite to typescript and modified the function call order to have the updated modelstate instead of the pre-updated modelstate.

The folder Test contains an example of how it works.
